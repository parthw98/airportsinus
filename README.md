# Airports in Different US States
## Lab 03: Web Map Design

![](mapimage.png)

Web Maps are interactive maps produced, used, and accessed on
the World Wide Web and are built using Geographic Information
Systems, codes and visualization tools.

This Web Map visualizes all the airports in different states of USA.

It produces a chloropleth map to display the states with
maximum airports in dark colors (Red) and states with the
minimum number of airports in lighter colors (Yellow).
This helps in highlighting all the states having more
airports which helps in predicting which places will have
the maximum air traffic. This is not only useful for pilots
but also useful for government air/flight authorities as it
helps them in assigning Air Traffic officers who are centrally
appointed to different states since 9/11.

#### Primary Functions

Some of the primary functions used were geojson.ajax and innerHTML
for coding purposes. I also used L to refer to the leaflet library
and call in some useful functions. It was also good to have Issues
on Github to resolve problems occuring during programming.

#### Libraries

I was able to develop this interactive web map with the help of
Leaflet Lavascript and CSS libraries, excellent icons provided
by Font Awsome, and beautiful fonts provided by Google APIS.

Leaflet.ajax and Jquery were instrumental in accessing and using geoJson file data and chroma.js provided viberant colors to enhance visualizations.

All these sources were open source and easy to access and use.

#### Acknowledgements and Source Credits

I am thankful to the US government for providing me the Airport data
to create this visualization. I also thank Mike Bostock from D3 for
publishing the State Data with the mention of the number of airports
in each state which was used to create the sequential color.
